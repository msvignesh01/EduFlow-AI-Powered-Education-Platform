EduFlow is a web-based platform designed to assist students and educators by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence. It provides a suite of tools to simplify complex topics, generate study materials, and offer instant academic support.

## ✨ Features

-   **🤖 AI-Powered Chatbot:** Engage in a dynamic conversation to get quick answers and explanations on any subject.
-   **❓ Question Answering:** Ask specific academic questions and receive detailed, AI-generated answers.
-   **📝 Text Summarizer:** Condense long articles, research papers, or notes into concise, key summary points.
-   **✍️ MCQ Generator:** Automatically create multiple-choice questions from a block of text to test comprehension and create quizzes.
-   **💻 Code Explainer:** Paste a snippet of code (in any popular language) to get a clear, line-by-line explanation of its functionality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python, Flask
-   **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT models)
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   **Core Libraries:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed on your system:
-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/msrishav-28/EduFlow-AI-Powered-Education-Platform.git](https://github.com/msrishav-28/EduFlow-AI-Powered-Education-Platform.git)
    cd EduFlow-AI-Powered-Education-Platform
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    -   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your secret OpenAI API key:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretOpenAI_API_KeyHere"
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask server:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your favorite web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
    ```

## 🔧 Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the platform through your browser:
1.  Navigate to the homepage.
2.  Choose one of the available tools (e.g., "Summarize Text", "Generate MCQs").
3.  Enter your text or question into the provided input field.
4.  Click the "Submit" button and wait for the AI-generated response to appear.

## ⚙️ How It Works

EduFlow is built using the **Flask** web framework.
-   The **frontend** (HTML, CSS, JS) captures user input (like text to summarize or a question).
-   This input is sent via an HTTP request to the **Flask backend**.
-   The backend server receives the request, processes the data, and makes an API call to the appropriate **OpenAI endpoint**.
-   OpenAI's model generates the AI-powered response (e.g., a summary, an answer, or MCQs).
-   The Flask backend sends this response back to the frontend, where it is dynamically displayed to the user.
